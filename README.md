Assignment 2 / CPE 123 / Josiah P., Celestine C., Sharmayne T., Gina F.

For our program, we initially started with the code posted in the course webpage and went from there.  
We wanted to keep the song position aspect of it, so we added the Y portion and made it control the volume.  
The state of our program is the position of the cursor, and that tells the program how loud it should play the song, and what part to play.  
To use our program, you just click or drag the mouse.  
Closer to the top is quieter and as it goes down it gets louder.  
Similarly, the left is the beginning of the song and the right is the end.
